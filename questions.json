Number of favourable outcomes = 90 – 9 = 81 (  here, except 1 to 9, other numbers are two-digit number.) Thus required probability = Number of Favourable Outcomes /Total Number of Possible Outcomes = 81/90 = 9/10. Total possible outcomes = 90. Number of favourable outcomes = 9 [here 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81 are the perfect squares] Thus the required probability = 9/90 =1/10  Total possible outcomes = 90.
